    <h2>Journal Entry</h2>
    <p>After reading *My Website is a Shifting House*, I started thinking about how I usually see websites as finished things instead of ongoing spaces. I tend to feel like I need to have everything figured out before I share something online, but this reading made that pressure feel unnecessary. A website can change as I change, and it does not need to be perfect or permanent. The idea of a website as a kind of home made me think about how digital spaces can feel personal instead of performative. I often edit myself online to seem more put together or professional, especially when I think other people are watching. This reading made me realize that a personal website does not have to impress anyone. It can simply hold ideas, experiments, and thoughts as they develop over time.
    Overall, this made me feel more comfortable with the idea of creating something unfinished. Letting a website exist as a work in progress feels more honest and less intimidating.
